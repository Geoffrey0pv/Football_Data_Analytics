## **APPLICATION WORKSHOP 1: Scouting Case**

You are part of the data analytics team at Sunderland AFC, a club in the English second division. Your team has been assigned to work on a project related to **recruiting players (scouting)**.

For this, you have access to a **FIFA video game database** that contains real information on **22,080 players worldwide**, collected in **February 2023**. This data is reliable, as the company has more than **6,000 scouts** across the world who continuously evaluate players' performance.

Your supervisor has asked you to provide a **description of the database** to better understand how it can be used. The dataset includes a **sheet with the variable dictionary**. Be sure to consult this information to understand the data properly.

Mainly, we are expected to answer the following questions:

---

**1. What type of variable is each column?
(Recall to classify them according to the 4 types discussed in class.)**

---

**2.Perform a complete descriptive analysis of the following columns:**

a) `Age`
b) `height_cm`
c) `position`
d) `club_country`
e) `overall`
f) `club_overall`
g) `value_millions`
h) `pref_foot`

---

**3. A member of the coaching staff claims that tall goalkeepers (GK) perform better overall. What can you conclude from a descriptive analysis (Note: use three height groups as a definition)**

`i) less than 185 cm.`

`ii) between 185 and 192 cm.`

`iii) more than 192 cm.`

------

**4. An analyst claims that **left-footed players** have **better performance (overall)** than right-footed ones. what can you say about this statement based on **descriptive analysis**?**

---

**5. A scout claims that the **best players**, according to their **overall performance rating**, play in clubs that belong to the **“Top 5 leagues”** (England, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France). What can you say about these two claims based on descriptive analysis**?

---

**6. Another scout claims that the **proportion of left-footed players** is higher in the **central midfielder (CM)** position than in the attacking midfielder (CAM) position. What can you say about this statement?**

---

**7. Another scout claims that the est players play in the best clubs in the world. Is it true that there is a **correlation** between a player’s performance (overall) and the **performance score of the club** they belong to (club\_overall)?**
